"""
Per-request database connection.

Peewee's connection state is thread-local, so the connection must be opened
and released on the thread that runs the handlers: the event-loop thread
(all routes are `async def`, and the DB-touching dependencies are too).
Opening it here rather than letting handlers autoconnect means a dead
database is a clean 503 `DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE` envelope instead of a 500.

Blocking DB work that runs in a worker thread (`asyncio.to_thread`) does not
see this connection; wrap it in `db.connection_context()` — see
`db.base.run_in_db_thread`.

`PHYSICALLY_CLOSE` selects `manual_close()` (a fresh connection every request)
over `close()` (return to the pool). The data-platform returns connections to
the pool; a connection that died with a DB restart surfaces once as a 503
whose handler evicts it (`core.middleware.render_error`).
