"""
Where provider credentials are read from and written to.

Credentials used to live in `usr.teams.league_info` as plaintext JSON alongside
non-secret fields. They now live encrypted in `usr.provider_connections`, keyed
by (user, provider, provider-side account) -- one row per real account instead
of one copy per team.

Every path is dual-mode so the migration can be deployed before it is completed:

    CREDENTIAL_KEYS unset    -> the store is off; secrets stay in league_info
                                exactly as before (local dev, tests, and the
                                deploy that precedes setting the variable)
    set, team unlinked       -> reads fall back to league_info, writes create a
                                connection and strip the secrets from the JSON
    set, team linked         -> reads decrypt, writes update the connection

So a team is migrated the first time it is written, and `scripts/backfill_provider_connections.py`
moves the rest. Nothing has to happen in a particular order.

The one rule callers must respect: hydrate only where credentials are actually
needed (provider calls), never on the path that builds an API response.
